                            <h2>Data Recovery Services Delta – Hard Drive/Disk Data Recovery</h2>
                            <p>Even a thought of a failed hard drive sends a chill down our spine, especially when sensitive data is at high risk of losing it forever. While there are many options to recover data, not all are equally secure and cost-effective.</p>
                            <p>Hard drives are the main storage area of all your data including your pictures, files, music, and whatnot. Most of your computer’s components are electronic and can only be damaged by electronic means such as a power surge.</p>
                            <p>However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener dofollow noreferrer">hard disks</a> are electronic and mechanical devices and they wear out, even if you treat them good with timely
                                maintenance. Most of the hard drive failures are mechanical failure, with the fewer number of failures occurring through misuse.</p>
                            <h3>Hard Drive/disk failure might occur due to:</h3>
                            <div class="listing">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your computer has dropped while it is running causing a shock to the hard drive.</li>
                                    <li>The electric motor fails which allows the platter to spin</li>
                                    <li>Excessive heating causes the electronic circuit board to fail</li>
                                    <li>There are lots of interrupted shutdowns or reboots due to power failure while the disk is writing</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <p>If the hard disk has S.M.A.R.T. technology (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), log files can be checked to identify the probability of failure in the future. S.M.A.R.T. monitors a wide range of hard disk
                                symptoms and logs the condition of the disk at each interruption. It aims to provide a predictable failure date for the disk.</p>
